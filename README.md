# Roadmap

 0. Make django mission success button that gives the characters glory/number of chars, and their team the same glory.
 1. Add django api (either djangorestframework or tastiepie, whichever looks easiest) and simply wrap the models in a autogenerated API, no need for auth or logic, as in the tutorial.
 2. build js player character sheet
 3. Build js ticker for news
 4. build js leaderboard for news
